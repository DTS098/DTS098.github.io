      <description>Since I began building websites in Y2K, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count how many times the phrase &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;there&amp;rsquo;s got to be a better way to do this&amp;rdquo; has passed my lips.

This concept attempts to explain the scoring opportunity at any time a player possesses the ball (the paper explores dangerousity through soccer). Various contextual measures formulated together create this metric.</description>
